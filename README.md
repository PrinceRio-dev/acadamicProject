# acadamicProject

311lab3 : This folder has Two server files and inside the html folder it has index.html file. 
          I have used Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX for completeing this project. In this project, I have made two differnt servers using Python programming language. 
          Both servers are identical but they are differ in the port numbers they listen from. For, the server1.py file port number is 8000 and for the 8001 port number. In this 
          folder there is a file name statsGen.py which will generate the random numbers. So, both the server files are using the statsGen.py file and sending the random generated 
          numbers to server. Now, in index.html file I have created simple we page using HTML and CSS with some background page. In this file, I have used two divs which is to
          display on webpage from bothe servers. On, we page you can see the random numbers are genearted in every second, and if you want to see other random numbers then you 
          have to click on the given button where I am using JavaScript and AJAX.
          This project is combination of back-end and front-end technologies.
